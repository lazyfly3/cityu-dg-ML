Exercise 1
[2 points]. Prove that the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix A ∈ RN ×N , where A = AT , are real-valued (i.e., not complex-valued).  Prove also that the eigenvectors of A corresponding to diferent eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other.
Proof.  a) let (λ, v) be any eigenpair of A.  Let A = AT  = A* ,
we have
< Av, Av > = v* A* Av = v* A* λv
= λv* Av
thus
Since λ2  is real and non-negtive number, λ must be real.
b)  For any real matrix A and any vectors x and y, we have
< Ax, y >=< x, AT y > .
We assume x and y are eigenvectors of A corresponding to distinct eigen- value λ and μ
λ < x, y > =< λx, y > =< Ax, y >
=< x, AT y >
=< x, Ay >
=< x, μy >
= μ < x, y > .
Therefore,
(λ - μ) < x, y >= 0.
Since λ  μ, we must have
< x, y >= 0,
that is, eigenvectors of real symmetry matrix are orthogonal.
Exercise 2
[5 points]. Derive the K-th largest direction of variance in principal compo- nent analysis (PCA).
Solution: Finding the K-th largest direction of variance vK  in PCA corre- sponding to solving the optimization problem:
max   vT Σv
v
s.t.    jj v jj   = 1
vT vi  = 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . , K - 1,
 ﬁnding v1  turns out to be
max   vT Σv
v
We write down its Lagrangian
L(v, λ) = vT Σv + λ(1 — jjv jj),                                (1)
                                               (2)
Hence Σv1  = λv1 , i.e.  v1  is an eigenvector of Σ with eigenvalue λ .  Since we
constrain vv1  = 1, the value of the objective is precisely
vΣv1  = λ,                                            (3)
so the optimal value for λ is the largest eigenvalue of Σ, which is achieved when v1  is a unit eigenvector of Σ corresponding to its largest eigenvalue. For vK , the Lagrangian is
K-1
which can be written as
Multiply both sides of the Eq.  (6) by vj , j = 1, . . . , K — 1, we have
K-1
Note that
                                         (8)
From the orthogonal constraints above we can conclude that
ηj  = 0, j = 1, . . . , K — 1.
Plugging these values back into the optimality equation above, we see that vK  must satisfy ΣvK  = λvK , i.e.  vK  is an eigenvector of Σ with eigenvalue λ . As before, the value of the objective function is then λ . To maximize, we want the largest eigenvalue, but we must respect the constraints that vK  is orthogonal to v1 , . . . , vK-1 . Thus to maximize the expression, vK  should be a unit eigenvector of Σ corresponding to its K-th largest eigenvalue.
Exercise 3
[5 points].  1) Suppose that a discrete-time linear system has outputs y[n] for the given inputs x[n], as shown in Fig. 1.  Determine the response y4 [n] when the input is as shown in Fig. 2.
a)  [1 point].  Express x4 [n] as a linear combination of x1 [n], x2 [n], and x3 [n].
b)  [1 point].  Using the fact that the system is linear, determine y4 [n], the response to x4 [n].
c)  [1 point].  From the input-output pairs in Fig.  1, determine whether the system is time-invariant.
2) Determine the discrete-time convolution of x[n] and h[n] for the fol- lowing two cases.
a)  [1 point].  As shown in Fig. 3.
b)  [1 point].  As shown in Fig. 4.
Solution: 1)
a)
x4 [n] = 2x1 [n] - 2x2 [n] + x3 [n]
b)
y4 [n] = 2y1 [n] - 2y2 [n] + y3 [n]
c) The system is not time-invariant because an input xi [n] + xi [n - 1] does not produce an output yi [n] + yi [n - 1].   The  input x1 [n] + x1 [n - 1] is x1 [n] + x1 [n - 1]  =  x2 [n], which we are told produces y2 [n].   Since y2 [n]  y1 [n] + y1 [n - 1], this system is not time-invariant.
2)
a)
y[0] = 2
y[1] = 4
y[2] = 6
y[3] = 8
y[4] = 6
y[5] = 4
y[6] = 2
y[7] = 0
b)
y[0] = 0
y[1] = 0
y[3] = 1
y[5] = 1
y[7] = 0
Exercise 4
[3 points] For a discrete-time signal x[n], the Discrete-Time Fourier Trans- form (DTFT) is deﬁned as
n=-∞
which is 2π-periodic. Its inverse transform is given by
                                (10)
Let x[n] and y[n] be two discrete-time signals, and assume they are absolutely summable. Prove the following property:
where the convolution in the frequency domain is deﬁned (with 2π-periodicity) as
Proof. Let z[n] = x[n]y[n].  By the deﬁnition of the DTFT,
n=-∞                              n=-∞
Substitute the inverse DTFT of x[n]:
                                (14)
Interchange the summation and integration, we obtain:
Hence,
